We are looking for people to take part in a closed pilot of a new social platform we're building â€“ Futon. We think that 1) meeting new people sucks, 2) planning in advance isn't fun, and 3) we all spend far too much time online.

That's why the only thing you can do on Futon is tap a button that tells other people you're up for doing something spontaneous. We then connect you with another person who's done the same thing and leave the two of you to make your plans.

That's it.

If you're a spontaneous person that loves meeting new and interesting people, we'd love for you to join the 100+ other pilot users who've signed up at <a href="https://www.tryfuton.com"><u><b>TryFuton</b></u>.</a>
