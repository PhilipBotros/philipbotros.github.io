Thrilled to announce our team's victory at this weekend's e/acc London hackathon!

Alongside my brilliant team mates <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-peric-ba81b5116/"><u>Luca Peric</u></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gietema/"><u>Jochem Gietema</u></a>, we competed against over 100 talented participants, vying for the first prize of $100,000 in Amazon Web Services (AWS) credits, an ElevenLabs plan, and an actual brain scan.

Our project, a venture into 'unlimited learning in your own fantasy world', brings to life the imaginative realms of 'The Diamond Age' by Neal Stephenson. By integrating a user's profile with an engaging storyline, we've developed a platform where complex concepts are explained through playful, story-consistent interactions.

Each character in this learning adventure offers their unique perspective, enriching the user's understanding through diverse interactions. A dedicated model adapted for each character ensures a consistent and immersive learning experience.

A huge thank you to the organisers, fellow participants, sponsors and judges for making this great event possible!
